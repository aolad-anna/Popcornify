    <string name="anna">The new 3/2 stereo sound format is recommended by specialist groups of CCIR, SMPTE and EBU. It provides an additional center channel and two surround channels, completing the left and right stereo channels, thereby offering an enlarged listening area and, at the same time, enhanced quality of the stereophonic presentation. A _-stereo loudspeaker arrangement may be used to improve the surround sound envelopment. A number of questions remain to be answered, but we may envisage applications of a universal 3/2-stereo sound system for transmission and recording, with and without accompanying picture, within the next few years. Practical aspects related to further improvements of the CCIR Draft Recommendation -Multi-channel stereophonic sound system with and without accompanying picture- are presented.The new 3/2 stereo sound format is recommended by specialist groups of CCIR, SMPTE and EBU.
